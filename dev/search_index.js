If g=nothing, the quantiles are estimated independently through the representation,\n\nboldsymbolq^(tau_t)(boldsymbolZ) = boldsymbolv^(tau_t)(boldsymbolZ) quad t = 1 dots T\n\nThe return value is a matrix with (p - textdim(boldsymboltheta_-i)) times T rows, where the first set of T rows corresponds to the estimated quantiles for the first parameter, the second set of T rows corresponds to the estimated quantiles for the second parameter, and so on.\n\nSee also IntervalEstimator and QuantileEstimatorContinuous.\n\nExamples\n\nusing NeuralEstimators, Flux, Distributions\nusing AlgebraOfGraphics, CairoMakie\n\n# Model: Z|θ ~ N(θ, 1) with θ ~ N(0, 1)\nd = 1   # dimension of each independent replicate\np = 1   # number of unknown parameters in the statistical model\nm = 30  # number of independent replicates in each data set\nprior(K) = randn32(p, K)\nsimulate(θ, m) = [μ .+ randn32(1, m) for μ ∈ eachcol(θ)]\n\n# Architecture\nψ = Chain(Dense(d, 64, relu), Dense(64, 64, relu))\nϕ = Chain(Dense(64, 64, relu), Dense(64, p))\nv = DeepSet(ψ, ϕ)\n\n# Initialise the estimator\nτ = [0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95]\nq̂ = QuantileEstimatorDiscrete(v; probs = τ)\n\n# Train the estimator\nq̂ = train(q̂, prior, simulate, m = m)\n\n# Assess the estimator\nθ = prior(1000)\nZ = simulate(θ, m)\nassessment = assess(q̂, θ, Z)\nplot(assessment)\n\n# Estimate posterior quantiles\nq̂(Z)\n\n\n# -------------------------------------------------------------\n# --------------------- Full conditionals ---------------------\n# -------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n# Model: Z|μ,σ ~ N(μ, σ²) with μ ~ N(0, 1), σ ∼ IG(3,1)\nd = 1         # dimension of each independent replicate\np = 2         # number of unknown parameters in the statistical model\nm = 30        # number of independent replicates in each data set\nfunction prior(K)\n\tμ = randn(1, K)\n\tσ = rand(InverseGamma(3, 1), 1, K)\n\tθ = Float32.(vcat(μ, σ))\nend\nsimulate(θ, m) = [ϑ[1] .+ ϑ[2] .* randn32(1, m) for ϑ ∈ eachcol(θ)]\n\n# Architecture\nψ = Chain(Dense(d, 64, relu), Dense(64, 64, relu))\nϕ = Chain(Dense(64 + 1, 64, relu), Dense(64, 1))\nv = DeepSet(ψ, ϕ)\n\n# Initialise estimators respectively targetting quantiles of μ∣Z,σ and σ∣Z,μ\nτ = [0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95]\nq₁ = QuantileEstimatorDiscrete(v; probs = τ, i = 1)\nq₂ = QuantileEstimatorDiscrete(v; probs = τ, i = 2)\n\n# Train the estimators\nq₁ = train(q₁, prior, simulate, m = m)\nq₂ = train(q₂, prior, simulate, m = m)\n\n# Assess the estimators\nθ = prior(1000)\nZ = simulate(θ, m)\nassessment = assess([q₁, q₂], θ, Z, parameter_names = [\"μ\", \"σ\"])\nplot(assessment)\n\n# Estimate quantiles of μ∣Z,σ with σ = 0.5 and for many data sets\nθ₋ᵢ = 0.5f0\nq₁(Z, θ₋ᵢ)\n\n# Estimate quantiles of μ∣Z,σ with σ = 0.5 for only a single data set\nq₁(Z[1], θ₋ᵢ)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"API/core/#NeuralEstimators.QuantileEstimatorContinuous","page":"Core","title":"NeuralEstimators.QuantileEstimatorContinuous","text":"QuantileEstimatorContinuous(deepset::DeepSet; i = nothing, num_training_probs::Integer = 1)\n(estimator::QuantileEstimatorContinuous)(Z, τ)\n(estimator::QuantileEstimatorContinuous)(Z, θ₋ᵢ, τ)\n\nA neural estimator targetting posterior quantiles.\n\nGiven as input data boldsymbolZ and the desired probability level tau  (0 1), by default the estimator approximates the tau-quantile of\n\ntheta_i mid boldsymbolZ\n\nfor parameters boldsymboltheta equiv (theta_1 dots theta_p).

If random=true (default), the neighbours are randomly selected from  within the disc (note that this also approximately preserves the distribution of  distances within the neighbourhood set). If random=false, a deterministic algorithm is used  that aims to preserve the distribution of distances within the neighbourhood set, by choosing  those nodes with distances to the central node corresponding to the  0 frac1k frac2k dots frack-1k 1 quantiles of the empirical  distribution function of distances within the disc.  (This algorithm in fact yields k+1 neighbours, since both the closest and furthest nodes are always included.)  Otherwise, \n\nIf maxmin=false (default) the k-nearest neighbours are chosen based on all points in the graph. If maxmin=true, a so-called maxmin ordering is applied, whereby an initial point is selected, and each subsequent point is selected to maximise the minimum distance to those points that have already been selected. Then, the neighbours of each point are defined as the k-nearest neighbours amongst the points that have already appeared in the ordering. If combined=true, the  neighbours are defined to be the union of the k-nearest neighbours and the  k-nearest neighbours subject to a maxmin ordering. \n\nIf S is a square matrix, it is treated as a distance matrix; otherwise, it should be an n x d matrix, where n is the number of spatial locations and d is the spatial dimension (typically d = 2). In the latter case, the distance metric is taken to be the Euclidean distance. Note that use of a  maxmin ordering currently requires a matrix of spatial locations (not a distance matrix).\n\nBy convention with the functionality in GraphNeuralNetworks.jl which is based on directed graphs,  the neighbours of location i are stored in the column A[:, i] where A is the  returned adjacency matrix.
