In the latter case, the distance metric is taken to be the Euclidean distance. Note that use of a  maxmin ordering currently requires a matrix of spatial locations (not a distance matrix).\n\nWhen using the k nearest neighbours, if maxmin=false (default) the neighbours are chosen based on all points in the graph. If maxmin=true, a so-called maxmin ordering is applied, whereby an initial point is selected, and each subsequent point is selected to maximise the minimum distance to those points that have already been selected.
